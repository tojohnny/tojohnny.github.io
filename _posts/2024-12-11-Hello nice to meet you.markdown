Hello reader,

Every once in a while, I get the urge to start developing something. Over the years, I’ve tried to build a personal website many times, but each attempt eventually fizzled out as I lost interest. 
This time feels different. It’s December 11, 2024, and with a daughter on the way, I feel a renewed sense of purpose. 
I want to create something meaningful—not just for the present but also as a contribution to my future self.

In 2019, I graduated from Worcester State University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. 
Like many fresh graduates, I believed I’d quickly land a role as a Software Engineer and start "making the big bucks," as people often said.
However, my motivation was more about the money than the effort I put into my studies, and that dream didn’t materialize.

Entering the job market without any internship experience to bolster my credentials was a harsh reality check. 
Application after application, days turned into weeks, and eventually into months. 
Rejection emails, ghosting, and non-replies became my new normal, and the weight of those experiences began to take a toll on my mind, sending me spiraling into despair.

If you think I was depressed at the time, you’d be mistaken. Instead, I was consumed by regret over the choices I had made along the way. 
Growing up, I loved video games—they were my escape, a place where I could express myself in a virtual world of endless possibilities. 
My obsession with MMORPGs gave me a sense of achievement that I struggled to find in real life. 
Building a character from the ground up, making strategic decisions to maximize efficiency, and rising above others at lightning speed—those were the things I thrived on in every game I played. But in real life? I couldn’t seem to replicate that success. I now realize it was likely due to an addiction to instant gratification. But let’s cut that story short.

My life truly began when I returned to the manufacturing company where I had worked during summer breaks in university. 
This company had helped me pay for my degree, and now, it gave me a chance to restart

I applied for a full-time position as an assembler and began working in a department I was already familiar with. 
However, things changed quickly. Within a couple of weeks, I was assigned to a new project, working on tasks I had never done before. 
Previously, I had mostly sat in a corner stripping fiber or running an assembly station. 
Now, I was collaborating closely with an Engineer, learning specialized tasks for development projects. 
Fast forward a few more weeks, and I was invited to join the Equipment Maintenance Department. I submitted my resume, scheduled an interview, and secured the new position.

The timeline was surreal: I went from being jobless for a year to landing a job and earning a promotion in less than a month. 
My passion for work reignited, and I resolved to accept every opportunity to learn and grow. I said yes to everything—no task was too small, no lesson was unworthy. 
Month by month, I gained more experience and built momentum.

Eventually, I found myself working in areas outside my assigned post. This led to meeting a coworker who would change my career trajectory. 
During a conversation, I realized that my manager might not know I held a Bachelor of Science degree. Acting on this advice, I sent an email to my manager, requesting work aligned with my education. 
That email led to a meeting, and before I knew it, I had earned another promotion. I became an Engineer.

Fast forward to today. Looking back, I can see how much I’ve grown, both professionally and personally. Life has been a journey of unexpected turns, and I’m proud of where I stand today.
